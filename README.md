# Language-Predictor
There is 2 version of the Language Predictor:
1. detect language using langdetect (Probabilistic Language Identification.py)
2. predict language of a letter being English of Spanish using Bayes Rules

There is a letter.txt provided that the programs will read and determine the languages.
Additional Samples are provided for more testing. They can be used by pasting the text into the letter.txt
Note: letter4.txt is in German, which the 2nd version doesn't recognize.
